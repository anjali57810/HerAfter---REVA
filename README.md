## Additional Documentation

### For Web Projects with Backend:
  Backend Setup

Choose a backend framework (Node.js + Express, Python + Flask/Django, etc.)

Create routes for features that currently use localStorage:

/api/chat → AI chatbot messages

/api/exercises → Exercise progress

/api/tracker → Mood, sleep, and baby data

/api/shop → Cart, wishlist, product data

/api/blog → Blog posts & research references

Database Integration

Use a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store:

User accounts & authentication

Exercise & tracker data

Shopping cart & orders

Blog posts & comments

Implement CRUD operations for each module

Authentication & Security

Add user authentication (JWT, sessions, or OAuth)

Encrypt sensitive data like passwords

Validate all inputs to prevent injections
